# pyobjecttrack
An OpenCV based object tracking script in python


Note: This project has code which i obtained from an example from www.pyimagesearch.com

This project uses OpenCV's python binders and Python's Serial communication library to track a ball of predefined color an then rotate the camera towards the direction of the ball. I used a towerpro microservo connected to an arduino uno board to rotate the camera.

If you uncomment the commented code, the window will have a trace of the ball prositions.
